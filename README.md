# SCT_WD_4
A fun and interactive To-Do web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can compete against each other or the computer. The game handles user clicks, tracks game state, and checks winning conditions for an engaging experience.
# 📝 To-Do List Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a basic yet powerful To-Do web application that helps users manage tasks efficiently. Users can create multiple lists, add and organize tasks, set due dates and times, mark tasks as completed, edit or delete tasks, and track their productivity in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## ✨ Features
- Create and manage multiple task lists
- Add new tasks with title, description, and due date & time
- Edit and delete existing tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or active
- Search tasks by title or description
- Filter tasks (All / Active / Completed)
- Sort tasks by created date, due date, or title
- Task statistics (Total, Completed, Active)
- Data persistence using browser localStorage
- Fully responsive and modern UI

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Application structure
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – App logic, task management, and interactivity
- **LocalStorage API** – Saving data between sessions

## ⚙️ How the App Works
- Tasks and lists are stored as JavaScript objects and arrays.
- User actions (add, edit, delete, complete) update the app state dynamically.
- Tasks can be filtered, searched, and sorted in real time.
- All data is saved in the browser’s localStorage so tasks remain after reload.
